          <h2>So you wanna contact me, but first lets give a little insight to Mrs Jackie Aljam-Moses</h2>
          <p>
            Well... My family is on the bigger side of things, my father is James Victor Bob from Sts'ailes (Chehalis), British Columbia, although he grew up on Coldwater Indian Band. My mother is Grace Aljam of Coldwater Indian Band. My grandparents on my fathers side is Ada Bob (Coldwater) & John Victor Mack (Sts'ailes), my mothers side Elizabeth Harry (Aljam) from Lower Nicola Indian Band & Sandy Aljam (Upper Nicola Indian Band). My mother has 9 siblings, and my father has 12 siblings, needless to say a larger than normal family. I grew up with my brother mostly, we were put in care at the younger age. Me and my siblings never grew up together, we only really grew up when I was around the age 10. I have 3 other siblings Manie Aljam, Dion Aljam, Tyson Aljam & Jackie Aljam-Moses.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Growing up without my siblings has indeed affected my life, in the system and/or places I grew up with the fact that my brother could be taken without notice and I could be left on my own in a place I do not know, by myself without knowing how to get ahold of any of my family. I had the constant fear of losing my only family I knew, it wasn't until I was 10 that <em>my loving aunty Elieen Aljam</em> was willing to take me, my brother and sister Dion in her care. Elieen had taken in my sister Manie at a younger age, it wasnt until I was 10 that my brother and I was placed in her care. My sister Dion was also in her care a couple months before my brother and I were placed there.

          <h3>~And This Is Where Technology Comes Into My Life~</h3>

          <br>

          <p>
            So now that I was in a place of comfort and ease... everything seemed to become normal for me and my family... one day at school there were these magical things on tables in the corner... They were <b>huge</b> monitors and towers... I hoped to know what those were and if the students would be able to use these things.... later on that same day the teacher brought us over and told us they were computers, and that we would be using them to learn to type, and possibly play a couple games... but first we had to earn our way to go on, so to get on one of these computers, we had a list we signed up on..then we had to do paper work or clean up outside to play games... but the #1 rule was all your work had to be completed without any mistakes because if you had a mistake you had to fix it. After some time, I knew technology wasn't going anywhere. I knew at a young age, that this is what I wanted to do and I still believe it. <b>Technology has never gone away, it has evolved and changed how life is and will be. </b> I hope to teach my chilren, nieces & nephews anything and everything I can about technology.
