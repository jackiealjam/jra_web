          <h2>So you wanna contact me, but first lets give a little insight to Mrs. Jackie Aljam-Moses</h2>
          <p>
            Well... My family is on the bigger side of things, my father is James Victor Bob from Sts'ailes (Chehalis), British Columbia, although he grew up on Coldwater Indian Band. My mother is Grace Aljam of Coldwater Indian Band. My grandparents on my fathers side is Ada Bob (Coldwater) & John Victor Mack (Sts'ailes), my mothers side Elizabeth Harry (Aljam) from Lower Nicola Indian Band & Sandy Aljam (Upper Nicola Indian Band). My mother has 9 siblings, and my father has 12 siblings, needless to say a larger than normal family. I have 2 sisters, Manie & Dion Aljam, and 1 brother Tyson Aljam. But growing up closer to my cousins, I will always think of them as my brothers and sisters.

            I'm from <a href="https://www.coldwaterband.com">Coldwater Indian Band,</a> I spent most of my teen years on reserve. Our reserve was always on the "smaller" side of how many people lived on reserve therefor (in my opinion) technology wasn't on top of everyones need list. So as computers came into the school I found them so interesting and fasinating. I always wanted to be on a computer learning what it was capable of and what I could do on there. I belive that is where I learned to love technology. The computers back then for students were made for typing class and writing long essays and such. There was the odd time we would be able to play games or send emails back and forth, this was before MSN messenger people... My first computer screen was black and green... then black and white... then apple came out with their big ol color computers, which i loved because they also came out with those word games, i could play that all day.

          <h3>~And This Is Where Technology Comes Into My Life~</h3>

          <br>

          <p>
            So the computers at school is where I knew technology was evolving every day. Looking back at the computers back then to the laptop I am currently using, it has changed drastically. There was no mouse, we had floppy disks, control alt delete was a thing, where we had to warm up the whole computer, and There was a hum when it started up. I felt like this was just the start of how we would be implementing more technology into our life, I thought because of some of the movies they had out back then. Thinking computers were a way of life, you could do so much with them and then some more, I didnt think there were limits to computers back then, I was young. So using computers when I was younger sure has had a big impact on how I live my life today. I wouldnt say I had a smart house, but I think if I didnt life off grid I would have more AI things going on.

            To the laptop for going to school, to my phone for checking the weather or to watch one of the many video streaming apps. I feel that technology has come a long way in a short period of time, its only being improved from its basic function.
