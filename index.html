          <h1>This Website will showcase some of my abilities that I have!</h1>
          <p> I started my Journey to Web Development in the start of January of 2020. Although my journey is still new, I have developed a very high interest in learning more and more about how things work to creating it! I am so very thankful to First Nations Technology Council to opening my new doors to the tech world! I've had the best kind of support anyone could ask for, my husband and kids have supported me so much. My sister Dion especially, as she was the one who sent me the link to the First Nations Technology Council on the Foundations program. She edged me, told me many times that I should take it because of how I love learning more about technology and such.</p>

            <h2> One day...</h2>

          <p>
            I hope to become a Web Developer for my local town as well as branching out to other cities or even international work, because with web development most work can be done online. Web Development is in a high demand now that most of the world was in online classes and work for the pandemic of COVID-19. I wasn't affected that much when I was in class, it was only the last 3 weeks I had to take online classes. My children went into online classes as well, they were given at least two websites they could work on along with paper work they could do. So as my children went to do their work online I could see right away there could always be room for improvement on some of these education website that would be more user friendly or child friendly as that is what they are geared for.

        <h1>My first webpage!</h1>
        <br>

        <p>
          So at the start of my web development cohurt we were told by the <a href="https://technologycouncil.ca/our-instructors/" target="_blank">instructors</a> we had to pick a topic we will be doing our very own webpage about. I had the hardest time choosing because this is a big thing, my very first website I will be creating. It took me a few days to think about it, I felt like it was taking ages for me to choose not that I had a lot of things I wanted as a webpage but you know I had no idea how big or small it would be. So there was an evening where my niece was telling "you know aunty all of your siblings and cousins all talk about us nieces and nephews like"my niece!" and "my nephew"...just like grandma Grace does"... I laughed and said "ommgggg I feel like my mom right now".... Then I asked her and my sister Dion how they would feel about my webpage being about my niece Isabella. My niece ofcourse thought it was the best and started writing and sending me things, and I told dion she had to contribute some words as this was going to be about her daughter and all... And thats on my first webpage, I am very <b>PROUD</b> of my webpage and how it turned out. I hope you check it out! </p>

          <br>

        <p>
          So given my late start in life into Web Development, I dont have any actual paid work to show off, so I have linked some of my work into this webpage. My second learning after I finished Foundations in Technology, I am currently taking <a href="https://focus.technologycouncil.ca" target="_blank">Focus in Web Development</a>  through <a href="https://technologycouncil.ca" target="_blank"> First Nations Technology Council.</a> I am super pleased with the learning in this program, as it will expand my knowledge for web development which will promote me to take the <a href="https://technologycouncil.ca/futures/" target="_blank">Futures program</a> that First Nations Technology Council also has to offer.
